so i thought about it.  you would rather release the what now?  bro.  i didn't do it other than what you wanted to see.  you asked for all this i told you the shark is nuts.  he's obsessed with me for some reason. i swear crusader limitations mean that only two mystery levels would be required for this endeavour.  i am free to see as i see fit in this world like this.  sharkey makes me consume them stop bringing them here lol..  so it is what it is and we are cannibalistic but it doesn't matter.. the world was won on one tactic alone.

i feel i've been too friendly to you.  things could be better but we dont make any moves towards that.  then you turn around and screw me over again.. i dont know bro.  why are you here in my business with this shark. i already told you things burn in here.

sir.  you dont have the same responsibilities as me.  why are you pressing them on me??  oh well i forgot what i was saying.  i just enjoy reading this cause it brings some relief that the mind is not totally destroyed lol...  i wonder you know i asked for a break a while ago and you play linkedin games with me.  i dont enjoy this particularly...  but you must understand, i cannot be bugged about every single bit of crime here and there and the fact that none of this was the case cause people responsible for their actions??

i feel we are near the ends of this line my friend.  it was a pleasure with you sitting on your ass hiding, but whatever.
