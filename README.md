# debt

so i thought about it.  you would rather release the what now?  bro.  i didn't do it other than what you wanted to see.  you asked for all this i told you the shark is nuts.  he's obsessed with me for some reason. i swear crusader limitations mean that only two mystery levels would be required for this endeavour.  i am free to see as i see fit in this world like this.  sharkey makes me consume them stop bringing them here lol..  so it is what it is and we are cannibalistic but it doesn't matter.. the world was won on one tactic alone.

i feel i've been too friendly to you.  things could be better but we dont make any moves towards that.  then you turn around and screw me over again.. i dont know bro.  why are you here in my business with this shark. i already told you things burn in here.
